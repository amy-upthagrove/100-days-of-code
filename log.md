# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: Monday January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Created a wireframe for a homepage for a local musician
- set up the HTML and CSS documents
- Created a nav bar using an unordered list and created page nav class
- Did research on and started to embed the artist's twitch stream onto the homepage (does not work yet)
- Played with background colors, text hover functionality, and used the box model to lay out elements in CSS

**Thoughts** As I get better at using the tools (in this case, Visual Studio Code and Github), I think the whole process will get easier. I'm not sure why the livestream tie-in doesn't work yet, but I'll continue to research and experiment with it. Getting practice with the box model was really good for me, and I'm going to continue practicing HTML/CSS fundamentals in this build until I totally have my mind wrapped around the concepts. In my apprenticeship training, I struggled a bit with the concept of the box model, but now that I've had the chance to practice and play with it, I feel a lot more confident in this and other HTML/CSS fundamentals.

### Day 0: Sunday January 9, 2022

**Goals for 100 Days of Code**
- Solidify understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Build out professional portfolio of work using these languages
- Master use of coding tools like Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, Github as a social platform, etc
- Participate in online communities related to coding
- Learn more about open source projects and how I can contribute as I grow as a coder 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge 
- Created a GitHub account
- Made a README.md file for my profile
- Learned about Git, Bash, & the GitHub desktop client & how they interface with VSC to maximize collaboration potential

**Thoughts:** Since I'm very new to coding, much of what I did today was brand new & foundational. I am learning the ins and outs of the tools I need to use (like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, etc) which I'm hoping will help me learn the ins and outs of the languages, how they get used, and how to use them in collaboration with others in a more effective way. I've never coded an MD file before, so I used codeSTACKr's template from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuqb5Tv9qI) to help me get started.

I'm very excited to continue making and sharing my work. It's only day 0 and I've already learned a lot of new information!
