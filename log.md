# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: Sunday, January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Read about & practiced the following HTML/CSS concepts: the box model, flex boxes, & responsive design
- Continued playing with the HTML/CSS for the toggleable tab menu on the June Gloom website
- Started building out a blog from scratch - set up header, nav bar, cards for blog posts, and a two-column layout using the float property

**Thoughts:** After dedicating a full hour to playing with CSS positioning rules, I finally feel confident in my grasp of the box model and how to float elements to create multi-column layouts. Although I started out working off the W3 template for responsive blog design, I took the time to examine each line of the template to make sure I could write it on my own. 

I'm looking forward to adding additional elements to the blog, like expandable/ collapsable posts, ways to foster user engagement (like a favorite button or comment section), and more interesting styling. I'm going to try to add one function to the blog each coding session I have.

### Day 10: Thursday, January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**

:heavy_check_mark: Read more [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) - focus on logical operators, completed all tasks for chapter  

:heavy_check_mark: Practiced git bash commands - focus on setting up a remote repository on GitHub from the git terminal  

:heavy_check_mark: worked on longterm project - [June Gloom Website](https://amy-upthagrove.github.io/June-Gloom-Website/) - started adding a toggleable tab menu and experimented with CSS layout rules  

:heavy_check_mark: unwound by practicing some [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) livecoding - focused on using samples, pulling samples from local directories, setting up loops, and randomization 

**Thoughts** I had a little more time to focus on this challenge than I have the past few nights, so I feel like I covered a lot of ground but had a lot of fun doing it. After pushing through the Modern JS Tutorial exercises, I realized I need to practice logic a little more. I'm not used to thinking in such a concise way but the more I practice, the more it will make sense. 

Also, I'm still not totally confident in my use of git bash commands, but the more I practice, the easier it will get. I'm challenging myself to use the terminal and remote repositories with each coding project I work on so I get more comfortable with it every time. I need to take some time to wrap my mind around the documentation for adding toggleable tabs, because I've got some bugs that I don't understand yet. 

I had a lot of fun playing around with Sonic Pi tonight. The randomization parameters you can set on pretty much any attribute makes simple code sound fascinating. I took inspiration from the [Healing Vibrations Singing Bowl Videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/HealingVibrationsMedia) I wake up to most mornings. Adding a weird digital sounding effect to the randomly pitched and timed bell sample intermittently takes the sound to a weird place, but I think it's fun. Copy/ paste/ run the code linked below into any Sonic Pi terminal to hear what it sounds like!

### Day 9: Wednesday, January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Finished the image getter project with a little help from one of my apprenticeship training classmates. I was using the wrong API key :/
- Continued reading through [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) - focused on comparisons and conditional branching
- Practiced git terminal commands with an emphasis on creating and merging branches, and pushing/ pulling to/from remote repositories

**Thoughts**: So glad I finally finished the image getter and that the solution was relatively simple. Digging deeper into APIs and how to fetch them helped shed more light on promises, which I stumbled across last night. It feels really good to build on new knowledge so steadily!

### Day 8: Tuesday, January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Continued working on image getter project - made some progress, still working on correctly autheticating my user key. 
- Reviewed fetch() and then() methods
- Continued reading through [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) - focused on type conversions and basic operators/ math

**Thoughts**: Today I hit a road block with the image getter project. I wasn't expecting to take so long figuring out the authetication key, but that's ok. I'm sure once I figure out why it's not working, I'll remember the solution more readily when I run into it again in the future. It was good that my troubleshooting forced me to dive deeper into the fetch() and then () methods. This reading led me down a rabbit hole of "promises" and "asychronous calculations" - which seem super cool, even though I don't totally understand how to use these concepts yet.

### Day 7: Monday, January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Continued reading through [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) - focused on coding structures, strict mode, variables, data types, and alerts/prompts
- Completed Codecademy's lesson on functions, which covered functions, returns, function expressions, and arrow functions
- Started working on an image getter project where user can do an image search and an image from Unsplash's API will appear on the page.

**Thoughts**: I am starting to get the hang of some basic JS syntax. Writing code without a guideline for how it should be structured is getting easier for me. I know the more I practice, I'll get even faster and smoother. Functions are really cool, they seem to be the brains behind using JS for a lot of logic and calculations. I want to continue practicing defining functions so I can write more complex calculations and arguments in a streamlined way. Since functions are a major part of most JS code I've worked with, I know I'll easily achieve my goal of getting faster and figuring out the syntax since I'll use them a lot.

### Day 6: Saturday, January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Reviewed concepts including the DOM, eventListeners, API's, flex boxes, and directories
- Practiced Git Bash terminal commands, focusing on using the terminal to navigate directories, add files to repositories, and to push/ pull from main branches on GitHub repositories from the Bash terminal
- Read through the intro sections of [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

**Thoughts**: The more comfortable I get with using Git Bash commands in the terminal to interface with GitHub repositories, the more I see advantages to using the terminal to manage files. I'm looking forward to more opportunities to use GitHub in collaboration with other people. Although I didn't really make anything with code today, I'm glad I got a chance to get more comfortable with the terminal. I can now use cd commands to comfortably move forward and backwards through directories, ls to get info on specific directories, and git commands to get repo info, track previous commits, add files, add orign from remote to local terminal, and create/ commit branches.

### Day 5: Friday, January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Started making myself cheat sheets for frequently used Git Bash cmds, VS code hotkeys, and useful JS syntax
- Gave my brain a little break from writing code in a brand new langauge and revisted [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), a live code synth instrument. Made it about halfway through the tutorial to brush up. Looking forward to playing with this more after taking a little sabbatical from making music this way.
- completed a gif finder using HTML, JS, and Tenor Gif API
- Spent a lot of time reviewing my notes from the past week of my apprenticeship training

**Thoughts**: Whoops! Forgot to post my log yesterday, it was a tiring first week of JS/React training. I can't believe how much information I've absorbed in such a short period of time. Doing this challenge while taking this apprenticeship training is definitely not easy, but making the time for it has forced me to make sure I'm deepening my understanding of the many concepts and skills we're learning. Doing this challenge also helps me identify my opportunities for improvement. Based on that, throughout the next week or so, I plan on focusing on the Inspector/ Console (and how I can use it more effectively for debugging), Git and GitHub (solidify understanding of how to use the Git terminal to tie into GitHub for effective collaboration). and specific JS syntax that I need to be able to write more readily/ quickly (at the moment, I am a very slow coder but I'd like to get faster while maintaining accuracy).

I'm glad I took some time to get reacquainted with Sonic Pi. I love this tool. I started using it about 2 years ago to prepare for learning Crestron (room/ AV automation control system software) Programming at a previous job. Since I had never coded before, I wanted to learn the standard conventions of coding logic & structure in a fun way. Sonic Pi really helped prime me for better understanding and I even made an [entire concept album](https://junegloomwi.bandcamp.com/album/low-level-drifts) using the program.

### Day 4: Thursday January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- did a [deep dive on REST APIs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)
-  made a button that when clicked makes a random kanye west quote display on the page, sourced from the [kanye rest api](https://kanye.rest/)
-  made good progress on my Vacation Destination form/display card - filling out the form and hitting submit now creates a bootstrap card displaying the form input, which includes text fields and image urls
-  while reading about REST APIs, I discovered a rabbit hole I want to go down soon: [building a Simple CRUD app with Node, Express, and MongoDB](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)

**Thoughts** I feel like I am learning so much every day, and the most important thing that I learn is what I don't know. It's really exciting to start seeing the big picture and how each component works individually/ interfaces with each other. APIs are sort of mind blowing - I didn't know what they were before today but now I see how they are pretty much everywhere, making the online world work (ie paypal transactions, google map integrations into things like uber, gif keyboards, etc).

---

### Day 3: Wednesday January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued working on the form that populates a card, stuck on the form submission triggering card info creation/ population
- Wrote a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the console log and started to use the JS program to make a day and time clock that displays on an HTML document
- Started brushing up on flex boxes in CSS by reading [THIS ARTICLE](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

**Thoughts**: I am still getting the hang of the basic conventions of JS, and I just need to keep plugging away at internalizing the concepts so that applying them comes more naturally. Figuring out the logic for the current day and time took me a long time and I got some help from the [W3 JS Basics Exercise Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercise-1.php)

### Day 2: Tuesday January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Built a button clicker counter with a reset button using JS, HTML, & CSS
- Started building a form that populates a card with user input (incomplete)
- Used Bootstrap for HTML/CSS framework templates for the first time on both the clicker counter and the form
- Did more research on git and GitHub

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that completing short projects that test specific skills/ functionality works really well for my learning style because it quickly reveals where I need to direct my focus the most. Today, I found myself getting stuck on some fundamentals of how the DOM works and remembering which syntax to use where. I think it would be helpful for me to start compiling a reference sheet with examples of syntax I find myself frequently using - at least until I have a deeper grasp on how the concepts actually work in practice.

### Day 1: Monday January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Created a wireframe for a homepage for a local musician
- set up the HTML and CSS documents
- Created a nav bar using an unordered list and created page nav class
- Did research on and started to embed the artist's twitch stream onto the homepage (does not work yet)
- Played with background colors, text hover functionality, and used the box model to lay out elements in CSS

**Thoughts**: As I get better at using the tools (in this case, Visual Studio Code and Github), I think the whole process will get easier. I'm not sure why the livestream tie-in doesn't work yet, but I'll continue to research and experiment with it. Getting practice with the box model was really good for me, and I'm going to continue practicing HTML/CSS fundamentals in this build until I totally have my mind wrapped around the concepts. In my apprenticeship training, I struggled a bit with the concept of the box model, but now that I've had the chance to practice and play with it, I feel a lot more confident in this and other HTML/CSS fundamentals.

### Day 0: Sunday January 9, 2022

**Goals for 100 Days of Code**
- Solidify understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Build out professional portfolio of work using these languages
- Master use of coding tools like Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, Github as a social platform, etc
- Participate in online communities related to coding
- Learn more about open source projects and how I can contribute as I grow as a coder 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge 
- Created a GitHub account
- Made a README.md file for my profile
- Learned about Git, Bash, & the GitHub desktop client & how they interface with VSC to maximize collaboration potential

**Thoughts:** Since I'm very new to coding, much of what I did today was brand new & foundational. I am learning the ins and outs of the tools I need to use (like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, etc) which I'm hoping will help me learn the ins and outs of the languages, how they get used, and how to use them in collaboration with others in a more effective way. I've never coded an MD file before, so I used codeSTACKr's template from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuqb5Tv9qI) to help me get started.

I'm very excited to continue making and sharing my work. It's only day 0 and I've already learned a lot of new information!
