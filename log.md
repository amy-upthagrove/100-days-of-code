# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: Friday, January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- Started making myself cheat sheets for frequently used Git Bash cmds, VS code hotkeys, and useful JS syntax
- Gave my brain a little break from writing code in a brand new langauge and revisted [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), a live code synth instrument. Made it about halfway through the tutorial to brush up. Looking forward to playing with this more after taking a little sabbatical from making music this way.
- completed a gif finder using HTML, JS, and Tenor Gif API
- Spent a lot of time reviewing my notes from the past week of my apprenticeship training

**Thoughts**: Whoops! Forgot to post my log yesterday, it was a tiring first week of JS/React training. I can't believe how much information I've absorbed in such a short period of time. Doing this challenge while taking this apprenticeship training is definitely not easy, but making the time for it has forced me to make sure I'm deepening my understanding of the many concepts and skills we're learning. Doing this challenge also helps me identify my opportunities for improvement. Based on that, throughout the next week or so, I plan on focusing on the Inspector/ Console (and how I can use it more effectively for debugging), Git and GitHub (solidify understanding of how to use the Git terminal to tie into GitHub for effective collaboration). and specific JS syntax that I need to be able to write more readily/ quickly (at the moment, I am a very slow coder but I'd like to get faster while maintaining accuracy).

I'm glad I took some time to get reacquainted with Sonic Pi. I love this tool. I started using it about 2 years ago to prepare for learning Crestron (room/ AV automation control system software) Programming at a previous job. Since I had never coded before, I wanted to learn the standard conventions of coding logic & structure in a fun way. Sonic Pi really helped prime me for better understanding and I even made an [entire concept album](https://junegloomwi.bandcamp.com/album/low-level-drifts) using the program.

### Day 4: Thursday January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**

- did a [deep dive on REST APIs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)
-  made a button that when clicked makes a random kanye west quote display on the page, sourced from the [kanye rest api](https://kanye.rest/)
-  made good progress on my Vacation Destination form/display card - filling out the form and hitting submit now creates a bootstrap card displaying the form input, which includes text fields and image urls
-  while reading about REST APIs, I discovered a rabbit hole I want to go down soon: [building a Simple CRUD app with Node, Express, and MongoDB](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)

**Thoughts** I feel like I am learning so much every day, and the most important thing that I learn is what I don't know. It's really exciting to start seeing the big picture and how each component works individually/ interfaces with each other. APIs are sort of mind blowing - I didn't know what they were before today but now I see how they are pretty much everywhere, making the online world work (ie paypal transactions, google map integrations into things like uber, gif keyboards, etc).

### Day 3: Wednesday January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Continued working on the form that populates a card, stuck on the form submission triggering card info creation/ population
- Wrote a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the console log and started to use the JS program to make a day and time clock that displays on an HTML document
- Started brushing up on flex boxes in CSS by reading [THIS ARTICLE](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

**Thoughts**: I am still getting the hang of the basic conventions of JS, and I just need to keep plugging away at internalizing the concepts so that applying them comes more naturally. Figuring out the logic for the current day and time took me a long time and I got some help from the [W3 JS Basics Exercise Solution](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercise-1.php)

### Day 2: Tuesday January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Built a button clicker counter with a reset button using JS, HTML, & CSS
- Started building a form that populates a card with user input (incomplete)
- Used Bootstrap for HTML/CSS framework templates for the first time on both the clicker counter and the form
- Did more research on git and GitHub

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that completing short projects that test specific skills/ functionality works really well for my learning style because it quickly reveals where I need to direct my focus the most. Today, I found myself getting stuck on some fundamentals of how the DOM works and remembering which syntax to use where. I think it would be helpful for me to start compiling a reference sheet with examples of syntax I find myself frequently using - at least until I have a deeper grasp on how the concepts actually work in practice.

### Day 1: Monday January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
- Created a wireframe for a homepage for a local musician
- set up the HTML and CSS documents
- Created a nav bar using an unordered list and created page nav class
- Did research on and started to embed the artist's twitch stream onto the homepage (does not work yet)
- Played with background colors, text hover functionality, and used the box model to lay out elements in CSS

**Thoughts**: As I get better at using the tools (in this case, Visual Studio Code and Github), I think the whole process will get easier. I'm not sure why the livestream tie-in doesn't work yet, but I'll continue to research and experiment with it. Getting practice with the box model was really good for me, and I'm going to continue practicing HTML/CSS fundamentals in this build until I totally have my mind wrapped around the concepts. In my apprenticeship training, I struggled a bit with the concept of the box model, but now that I've had the chance to practice and play with it, I feel a lot more confident in this and other HTML/CSS fundamentals.

### Day 0: Sunday January 9, 2022

**Goals for 100 Days of Code**
- Solidify understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Build out professional portfolio of work using these languages
- Master use of coding tools like Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, Github as a social platform, etc
- Participate in online communities related to coding
- Learn more about open source projects and how I can contribute as I grow as a coder 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Committed to #100DaysOfCode challenge 
- Created a GitHub account
- Made a README.md file for my profile
- Learned about Git, Bash, & the GitHub desktop client & how they interface with VSC to maximize collaboration potential

**Thoughts:** Since I'm very new to coding, much of what I did today was brand new & foundational. I am learning the ins and outs of the tools I need to use (like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, etc) which I'm hoping will help me learn the ins and outs of the languages, how they get used, and how to use them in collaboration with others in a more effective way. I've never coded an MD file before, so I used codeSTACKr's template from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECuqb5Tv9qI) to help me get started.

I'm very excited to continue making and sharing my work. It's only day 0 and I've already learned a lot of new information!
